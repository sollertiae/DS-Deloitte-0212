# Boosting

## Learning Goals

- describe boosting algorithms
- implement boosting models with `sklearn` and with `XGBoost`

## Lecture Materials

Jupyter Notebooks (there are two, unclear which is intended to be the lecture notebook):
- [Boosting Illustration](boosting_illustration.ipynb)
- [Boosting in SKLearn](boosting_in_sklearn.ipynb)

# Additional Resources

## Lecture Supplements

[This post](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-introduction-to-xgboost-3eaee2e3e5d6) may be helpful for describing the difference between standard and "extreme" gradient boosting.
